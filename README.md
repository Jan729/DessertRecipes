# DessertRecipes
A compact web application with a collection of my favourite recipes that I created myself or modified from existing recipes. I originally made this project while learning about HTML and CSS, then rewrote it with React.js to make the code easier to organize and reuse. I'll keep adding new recipes as I make them!
