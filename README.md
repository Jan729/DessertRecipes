# DessertRecipes
A compact web application with a collection of my favourite dessert recipes that I created myself. I originally made this project while learning about HTML and CSS, then rewrote it with React.js. This site is still under construction.

To view the project, clone the repo, and run ```npm install``` followed by ```npm start```
