        I came up with this recipe when I found some chocolate hazelnut bars lying around the house and decided to turn them into cookies. They turned out better than I expected! 
        The chopped chocolate bar worked well because the hazelnut pieces were coated with melted chocolate inside of the cookie, and the chocolate pieces were gooier than if I had used chocolate chips. Since most of the recipes I found online used chocolate chips instead of bars, I used several
        of the recipes as inspiration and modified the ingredients to accommodate my chocolate bar's ratio of chocolate to nuts. I added a little more flour to balance out the higher moisture content in the chocolate bar compared to the chocolate chips.

        <br><br>
        Substitution note:<br>
        If you like a crispier cookie, you can substitute the nutty chocolate bars with 3/4 cups chocolate chips, 3/4 cups chopped nuts of your choice and use 1 cup of flour instead of 1 1/8 cups. I think the chocolate chips melt to a lesser degree than the chopped chocolate pieces and keeps the cookie's orginal shape better.
